#### What is software?
- Software is a collection of computer program which helps us to perform a task.

#### What is manual testing?
- Manual testing is the process of human testers manually executing test cases without using any automation tools or script to verify the software application functions correctly working according to specified requirements or not before release.

#### Types of the software
	- System Software : 
		- Ex, Devices derivers, OS, servers, utilities etc
	- Programming software 
		- Ex, Compilers, Debuggers, Interpreters.
	- Applicaiton software
		- Ex, Web application, Mobile apps, Desktop application

##### NOTE : On top of the OS we are install other software it means OS is the base of all those software to run smoothly. We can use application soft. directly but we can't use programming or system software directly because of this is internal software. We can't see to them.


#### What is the actual process of software development?
- Suppose, there is X-Bank (Company) and they want to a soft. for automating the transaction process. They approach to the IT company and explain there requirements and say the budget. Then IT company will be stared the process of developing software. 

----> X-Bank (Company) ----->IT company ----> Develop ------> Test -----> Deliver -----> X-Bank

#### Why we are testing the product?
- Because of we have to release quality product to customer, that is the main intention of the testing of that specific product or software. If we provide buggy product to the customer that time the customer will be feasted

#### What is the software testing?
- Software testing is a part of the SDLC. Software testing is the systematic process of to detect and identify the detects in the software. The objective of the testing is to release quality product to the customer. 


#### What is the software quality?
- Quality is something called customer justification.
- We have set of parameters to check the quality of software. 
			- Bug-free
			- Delivered on time
			- Within budget 
			- Meets requirements
			- Maintainable

#### Project vs Product
- If soft application is developed for specific customer based on the requirement then it is called project. Ex, Banking automated transaction software.

- If soft. application is developed for multiple customers based on market requirements then it is called product.  Ex, WhatsApp, MS word Excel etc.
