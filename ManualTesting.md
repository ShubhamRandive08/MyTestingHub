#### What is software?
- Software is a collection of computer program which helps us to perform a task.

#### What is manual testing?
- Manual testing is the process of human testers manually executing test cases without using any automation tools or script to verify the software application functions correctly working according to specified requirements or not before release.

#### Types of the software
	- System Software : 
		- Ex, Devices derivers, OS, servers, utilities etc
	- Programming software 
		- Ex, Compilers, Debuggers, Interpreters.
	- Applicaiton software
		- Ex, Web application, Mobile apps, Desktop application

##### NOTE : On top of the OS we are install other software it means OS is the base of all those software to run smoothly. We can use application soft. directly but we can't use programming or system software directly because of this is internal software. We can't see to them.


#### What is the actual process of software development?
- Suppose, there is X-Bank (Company) and they want to a soft. for automating the transaction process. They approach to the IT company and explain there requirements and say the budget. Then IT company will be stared the process of developing software. 

----> X-Bank (Company) ----->IT company ----> Develop ------> Test -----> Deliver -----> X-Bank

#### Why we are testing the product?
- Because of we have to release quality product to customer, that is the main intention of the testing of that specific product or software. If we provide buggy product to the customer that time the customer will be feasted

#### What is the software testing?
- Software testing is a part of the SDLC. Software testing is the systematic process of to detect or identify the defect in the software. The objective of the testing is to release quality product to the customer. 


#### What is the software quality?
- Quality is something called customer justification.
- We have set of parameters to check the quality of software. 
			- Bug-free
			- Delivered on time
			- Within budget 
			- Meets requirements
			- Maintainable

#### Project vs Product
- If soft application is developed for specific customer based on the requirement then it is called project. Ex, Banking automated transaction software.

- If soft. application is developed for multiple customers based on market requirements then it is called product.  Ex, WhatsApp, MS word Excel etc.

#### Why do we need testing?
- We need testing to deliver quality product to the customer. This is the main intention of the testing the product.

#### Error, Bug and Failure
- a. Error : Error is a nothing but human mistake. 
		- Ex, Suppose the developer writing the code that time by mistake he typed something else this is called as 'Error'

- b. Bug (Defect) : Bug is nothing but deviation (gap) between of actual and expected result.
		- Ex, Whenever we provide valid username and password that time user should be login. And whenever provide wrong credentials that time user should be able to see error message, but infortunataly user might be able to login successfully, this is bug inside the login page.

- c. Failure : The product will be give to the customer and after few days, there got some errors or defect that is called as failure.


#### Why the software has bug?
- a. Miscommunication or no communication
- b. Software complexity
- c. Programming error
- d. Changing in requirements
- e. Lack of skilled testers


#### SDLC : 
		- Software Development Life Cycle means SDLC
		- SDLC is a process used by software industry to desing, develop and test 		softwares. 

###### The phases of SDLC :
			Requirement Analysis ----> Design ----> Development ----> Testing ----> Deployment ----> Maintainance



			1. Phase 1. Requirement Analysis : 
				It is a phase where the client/business requirements are collected and analysed to understand what the software should do. A dedetiled SRS (Software Requirement Specification) document is created.

			2. Phase 2. Design :
				In this phase, the system architecture,design, database structure, UI layout, and technical specifications are prepared based on the requirements. This includes HLD (High level desing) and LLD (Low level design)

			3. Phase 3. Development : 
				This is the phase wehre developers write the actual code according to the desing documents. Each module is developed and tested individually (unit testing)

			4. Phase 4. Testing :
				In this phase, testers validate the software to ensure it meets the requirements. They find defects, report them, and verify bug fixes to ensure the product is stable and bug-free.

			5. Phase 5. Deployment :
				The tested software is released to the production environment so that end users can start using it. Deployment may happen in stages (alpha, beta or full release)

			6. Phase 6. Maintenance :
				After deployment, the software is monitored and updated to fix issures, improve performance, add new features, or adapt to new technologies. This encures the system fucntions smoothly over time. 

#### SDLC Models : 
		1. Spairal model
		2. Waterfall model
		3. V model (VV model)

##### BRS : Bussiness Requirement Specification
##### URS : User Requirement Specificaiton
##### CRS : Customer Requirement Specification
##### SRS : Software Requirement Specification
